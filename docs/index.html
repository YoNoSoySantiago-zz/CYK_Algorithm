    <h1>CYK Algorithm</h1>

            In computer science, the Cocke–Younger–Kasami algorithm (alternatively called CYK, or CKY) 
            is a parsing algorithm for context-free grammars published by Itiroo Sakai in 1961. The algorithm is 
            named after some of its rediscoverers: John Cocke, Daniel Younger, Tadao Kasami, and Jacob T. Schwartz. 
            It employs bottom-up parsing and dynamic programming.
            The standard version of CYK operates only on context-free grammars given in Chomsky normal form (CNF). 
            However any context-free grammar may be transformed (after convention) to a CNF grammar expressing the same language (Sipser 1997).
            The importance of the CYK algorithm stems from its high efficiency in certain situations. Using Big O notation, 
            the worst case running time of CYK is O ( n3 ⋅ | G | ), where n is the length of the parsed string and | G | 
            is the size of the CNF grammar (Hopcroft & Ullman 1979, p. 140). 
            This makes it one of the most efficient parsing algorithms in terms of worst-case asymptotic complexity, 
            although other algorithms exist with better average running time in many practical scenarios.
